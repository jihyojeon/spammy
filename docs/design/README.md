# Design reference — The Spammy

Distilled from the team's Claude Design project ("Spammy": `The Spammy.dc.html`, `Show.dc.html`, `Host.dc.html`, `spammy-data.js`, read 2026-11-01). The design link needs a login, so this file is the version of record for contributors. Sample data lives in `apps/web/src/sample/brunch-club.ts` (fictional people, safe to commit).
